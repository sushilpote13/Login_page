# 🔐 Login & Register Page

Welcome to the **Login & Register Web Page** – a simple yet effective authentication UI using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to register and log in using browser-based `localStorage`. This project is perfect for learning front-end authentication basics without needing a backend server.

## 📂 Project Structure

```

📁 Login\_page/
├── 📄 index.html               # Main HTML file (login/register form)

## 🧠 How It Works

- When the page loads, it starts in **Login Mode**.
- Clicking **"Register"** changes the form to Registration Mode.
- In **Register Mode**, it stores the entered username and password in the browser's `localStorage`.
- In **Login Mode**, it compares the entered credentials with the saved ones.
- If the credentials match, it redirects the user to [your LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sushil-pote/).
- Otherwise, it shows an error alert.

## 🛡️ Important Notes

- This project is **not secure** for production. All data is stored in the browser's memory using `localStorage`.
- Do not use this method to store sensitive user information.
- For real-world apps, use **backend servers**, **databases**, and **encryption**.

## ✅ Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

Here are some ideas if you want to improve this project further:

- [ ] Add logout functionality  
- [ ] Add a “Show Password” toggle  
- [ ] Store multiple users (instead of just one)  
- [ ] Add basic input validation (min length, symbols, etc.)  
- [ ] Replace localStorage with sessionStorage or cookies  
- [ ] Integrate a backend like Firebase or Node.js for real database storage
